# Code fixes for catfish kata

- [ ] change reducer selector collocation to keep logic in the reducer
- [ ] edit file names of reducer and action
- [ ] move the display component (ChannelCatTable.js) into the container (catfish.com) as a const

@anthonykulis - these were the main takeaways I had from when we spoke last week. Do you want me to go further and try to integrate the aggregator functionality you wrote? Obviously there is further to go to make it look more similar to your solution - is there anything else that's important to you?
